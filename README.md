# CSS-gradient-Background-generator
A small JavaScript project that just randomizes background colors for your next project/website as a cool-ish gradient background

using the Math.Random function and multiplying it by the total possible combinations of RGB colors and then transforming it to a hexadecimal form.
to then it manipulates the DOM and changes its background color to the colors resulted by the operation that happened above.

Hope you like it :)
